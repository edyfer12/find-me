# find-me

This project will show on the browser the page enabling users to type in any keywords and click on the button to search for a webpage or anything related.
The web-page, Find Me, will have a similar structure to Google's Home Page with a massive logo with the following search bar and buttons placed below all 
centred on a page. To create this page, flexboxes will be used so containers and items are sized, positioned flexibly and there is appropriate 
spacing between flex-items. This is especially the case for structuring the header, content and footer as seen across many website/webpages.
